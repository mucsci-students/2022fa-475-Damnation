### bugs
- do not click the gear icon in the top right. It opens the pause menu but
disables the HUD for the player. Use the escape key to enter and exit the pause
menu.

- Do not fall off the cliffs in the 3rd level (which actually isn't too difficult). The kill barrier isn't working properly, so you'll simply land on it, and it'll be a pain in the ass to get back up.

- If you get stuck on the spiral staircase, swing your sword and you'll break free.

- If you agro all the skeletons in the area right before the 1st boss, they'll pile up on the fog gate and push each other through. To prevent this, hug the left mountain on your way to fog gate. That way, you'll only agro 3 of them, and they shouldn't come through unless you're right up against the fog gate during the boss fight.

- If your character is perpetually falling and stuck in the ground, find a slope and it should stop.

## Updates
### The updates are meant purely for fun. Do NOT review these, as they were released after the due date.

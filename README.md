### bugs
- do not click the gear icon in the top right. It opens the pause menu but
disables the HUD for the player. Use the escape key to enter and exit the pause
menu.

- Do not fall off the cliffs in the 3rd level (which actually isn't too difficult). The kill barrier isn't working properly, so you'll simply land on it, and it'll be a pain in the ass to get back up.

- If you get stuck on the spiral staircase, swing your sword and you'll break free.

- If you agro all the skeletons in the area right before the 1st boss, they'll pile up on the fog gate and push each other through. To prevent this, hug the left mountain on your way to fog gate. That way, you'll only agro 3 of them, and they shouldn't come through unless you're right up against the fog gate during the boss fight.

- If your character is perpetually falling and stuck in the ground, find a slope and it should stop.

### UE5 Official Steam Release
After updates 2.0 and 3.0, I will re-make the game in the Unreal Engine with its own music and sound effects. The maps will be re-done and the character models will be edited to look even more badass than they already are.

## Update patch notes
The updates are meant purely for fun. I would say "Don't review these", but we're already past the review period so we don't need to worry about it! :)

###### **Update 1.1:**
- Progress is now saved upon returning to the Main Menu (but NOT exiting the game).
- Reworked roll invincibility frames so they're tied to the animations rather than a timer that would sometimes bug out and not activate.
- Added a massive rock in the center of the Giant Skeleton boss room, which will allow players to separate them more easily.
- Made the benches in the Flooded Manor church more spaced apart to reduce the janky physics in the church. 
- The Start/Escape menu now displays the current area, time spent in-game, and total number of deaths.
- The final boss now does slightly more damage.
